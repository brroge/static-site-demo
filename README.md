FOUNDATIONAL Create a new repository in GitHub or CodeCommit and load the attached HTML. Create and configure a S3 bucket to host your static website. Create a CI/CD pipeline using the AWS Codepipeline service. Set your repo as the Source Stage of the Codepipeline that is triggered when an update is made to the repo. For the deploy stage select your S3 bucket. Deploy the pipeline and verify that you can reach the static website. Make an update to the code in your code in the repo to verify that the codepipeline is triggered. This can be as simple as changing the wording in the file because any change to the files should trigger the workflow. Note: you can skip the Build stage for this project. ADVANCED The team is happy with the pipeline, however there have been some issues where untested changes have made their way to the production website. Add a manual approval step so that a senior developer is notified via email to approve the changes prior to the updated code being pushed to the website bucket. Customers are also complaining of high latency with the website, so implement a Cloudfront distribution pointing to the website to resolve the issue.
